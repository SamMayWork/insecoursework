# uopform frontend
Frontend for the uopforum insecoursework project

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
This project runs entirely on the client side and doesn't require and additional software to work

## Running the tests
### Break down into end to end tests

### Coding style tests

## Deployment
This software is only the frontend of the project. To fully test the software,
clone the frontend and the backend repos, execute the backend server (which requires Node.js)
and change the XMLHttpRequests within the client-side to point to the server url.
NOTE: The client and the server must be run on the same server or modern browsers will complain
about CORS permissions.
